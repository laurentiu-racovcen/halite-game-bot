                <h2>About</h2>
        
                <h3>What is Halite?</h3>
                <p>Halite (the game) is a multiplayer turn-based strategy game played on a rectangular grid; the objective of the game is to take over the entire grid and eliminate the other players in the game.<br>Halite (the tournament) is an online programming competition where human coders write bots that play the Halite game against each other.</p>

                <h3>Where does the game come from? Who invented it?</h3>
                <p>The Halite game was created by <a href="https://github.com/Sydriax">Benjamin Spector</a> and <a href="https://github.com/truell20">Michael Truell</a> during a summer internship at Two Sigma in 2016.<br>The game format is inspired by the 2011 Ants AI Challenge sponsored by Google.</p>

                <h3>Why did you invent it?</h3>
                <p>Halite’s creators heard about the Ants AI Challenge a few years too late :-(<br>They couldn’t find any other competitions quite like it, so they decided to create one.</p>

                <h2>About the Tournament</h2>

                <h3>What's the goal of the competition?</h3> 
                <p>The goal of Halite is to provide a fun and deep testbed to try new ideas and compete in problem-solving. Furthermore, Halite is being used for recruitment of talent by its sponsors.</p>

                <h3>Who is running the tournament?</h3>
                <p>The Halite game has been designed and implemented by <a href="https://www.twosigma.com/">Two Sigma</a>, a highly-innovative, technological investment firm based in New York City.<br>The Halite tournament is jointly run with <a href="http://tech.cornell.edu/">Cornell Tech</a>, a new graduate school that brings together faculty, business leaders, tech entrepreneurs, and students in a catalytic environment to produce visionary results grounded in significant needs that will reinvent the way we live in the digital age.</p>

                <h3>How long is the tournament?</h3>
                <p>The tournament will run from November 2, 2016 to February 2, 2017.</p>

                <h3>How are rankings computed?</h3>
                <p>Rankings are based on the outcome of organized games where bots play against each other. A good analogy is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Elo rating system</a> used for chess.<br>More precisely, rankings are computed using a Bayesian algorithm variant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glicko_rating_system">Glicko system</a>, specifically using the TrueSkill Python library available <a href="https://github.com/sublee/trueskill">here</a>.</p>

                <h3>How are the winners decided?</h3>
                <p>Winners are simply the highest ranked players on the <a href="https://2016.halite.io/leaderboard.php">leaderboard</a> at the end of the competition. So, submit early and often!</p>

                <h3>Is there a prize for the winners?</h3>
                <p>Pride! Bragging rights! Internet royalty!<br>The results of the competition will be officially announced with a link to best players Github profiles.</p>

                <h3>What information do you store about me?</h3>

                <p>Is your organization not on there? <a href="https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite/edit/master/website/organizationWhitelist.txt">Edit the whitelist</a> and send us a pull request! We'll make sure to tag all members of your organization who have already signed up.</p>

                <h2>Bot Programming</h2>

                <h3>Do I need to be a programmer to play the game?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Halite is a programming competition. You need to program a bot that will play the game in the Halite tournament.<br>However, you definitely don’t have to be a very good programmer to play Halite effectively. Success is more about coming up with a good strategy to play the game than coding this strategy expertly.</p>

                <h3>What languages does the game support?</h3>
                <p>Any and all! If the language can read from stdin and print to stdout, we can support it.<br>We provide out-of-the-box starter packages for the following languages: Python, Java and C++. See <a href="https://2016.halite.io/downloads.php">here</a> for our growing list of starter packages.<br>We’re counting on the community to add support for as many languages as people want. Visit <a href="https://2016.halite.io/advanced_writing_sp.php">this page</a> for more information on writing your own starter package and the protocol used by the game environment to talk to your bot.

                <h3>How do I submit my bot?</h3>
                <p>To submit your bot, you'll first need to zip your source code. Then, after signing in, click the "Submit" button on the top-right part of the page. Then, simply select your zipped source code to submit.</p>

                <h2>The Code behind the Tournament</h2>

                <h3>Is the code open source?</h3>
                <p>Yes.<br>Check out our <a href="https://github.com/HaliteChallenge/Halite">Github repo</a> and you are also welcome (even encouraged) to open issues and/or submit pull requests.</p>

                <h3>How do I contribute to the game and/or report an issue?</h3>
